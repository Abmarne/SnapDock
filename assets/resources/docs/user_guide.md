## **Troubleshooting**

### **The editor isn’t saving my changes**
- If you're editing a file inside a workspace, changes save automatically.  
- If you're editing a standalone file, use **Save As** to choose a location.

### **A file won’t open**
- Ensure it’s a markdown file (`.md`).  
- If the file is inside a protected system directory, move it somewhere accessible.

### **The preview isn’t updating**
- Make sure preview mode is enabled using the **Preview Toggle** button.

### **Tabs are duplicating**
- This was fixed in the RC build. Update to the latest version if you still see this.
